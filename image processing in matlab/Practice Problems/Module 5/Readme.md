## Module 5

- level.m: This function was uploaded by prof. Ladak, and I rewrote it. It basically does the background removal (Levelling)! (In assignment 4, we are supposed to do a similar task but the points should be chosen automatically.) 

- imAve.m: This function Demonstrates noise reduction by image averaging.
